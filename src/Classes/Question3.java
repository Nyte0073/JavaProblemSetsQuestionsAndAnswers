class Power { //Clas Power to store the variable for the exponent and base numbers and the method to return the power between those two numbers.

    int exponent; //The exponent in the equation.
    int base; //The base in the equation.

    public Power(int exponent, int base) { //Power constructor to make sure that every Power object comes with its own Integer exponent and base.
        this.exponent = exponent;
        this.base = base;
    }

    public void powerOf() { //Creates a loop to make base multiply itself by itself a certain amount of times depending on the exponent.
        int sum = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < exponent; i++) {
           sum *= base;
        }
        System.out.println("Power: " + sum);
    }
