    /*Write an Employee class, that stores an employeeâ€™s first name,
    last name, ID (you can make up a random number), and annual
    salary. Implement functions getFirstName(), getLastName(),
    getFullName(), getID(), getSalary(), and raiseSalary(int percent),
    which raises the salary by whatever percent is inputted.
    Demonstrate the instantiation of two Employees in a
    different class that uses all the functions.*/
